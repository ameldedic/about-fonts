FONT FAMILIES

http://www.cssfontstack.com/
Web safe fonts are fonts that are pre-installed by many operating systems.
If you want to use fonts other than ones pre-installed, as of CSS3, 
you can use Web Fonts (downloading the fonts): http://www.cssfontstack.com/Web-Fonts.


font-families with fallbacks:

example:
font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
The browser will try the first one, if that one isn't available the second, 
and so forth. In the end it uses the family serif, so the browser choses any serif font.

examples:
font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', Tahoma, sans-serif 
font-family: "Lucida Console", Courier, monospace;
